# Nix notes

This is a collection of short notes about Nix and NixOS. Almost each note
corresponds to a page, to a Git commit, and to a Nix attribute that can be
built.


## How to read these notes

The notes should be read with a copy of this repository. To make each note
correspond to a commit, this repository is heavily rebased. When studying a
particular note, especially the first ones, it is best to checkout the
corresponding commit to see only the relevant files for that note.

In other words, running `git log --patch --reverse` should be a readable
tutorial about Nix and NixOS. Indeed, the following table of content is
generated with `git log --reverse`!
